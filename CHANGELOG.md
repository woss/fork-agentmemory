## [0.8.10] — 2026-04-15

**Behavior change**: the PreToolUse and SessionStart hooks no longer run enrichment by default. SessionStart saves ~1-2K input tokens per session you start (the only path that was actually reaching the model, per the [Claude Code hook docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks.md)). PreToolUse stops spawning a Node process and POSTing to `/agentmemory/enrich` on every file-touching tool call — a pure resource cleanup, not a token fix. If you were relying on either path, set `AGENTMEMORY_INJECT_CONTEXT=true` in `~/.agentmemory/.env` and restart. Observations are still captured via PostToolUse regardless.

### Fixed

- **Gate SessionStart context injection** ([#143](https://github.com/rohitg00/agentmemory/issues/143), thanks [@adrianricardo](https://github.com/adrianricardo)) — `src/hooks/session-start.ts` previously wrote ~1-2K chars of project context to stdout at every session start. Per the [Claude Code hook docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks.md), `SessionStart` stdout is explicitly injected into the model's context ("where stdout is added as context that Claude can see and act on"), so this was adding real tokens to the first turn of every new session. Now gated behind `AGENTMEMORY_INJECT_CONTEXT`, default off. The session still gets registered for observation tracking — only the stdout echo is skipped.
- **Skip the PreToolUse enrichment round-trip when disabled** ([#143](https://github.com/rohitg00/agentmemory/issues/143)) — `src/hooks/pre-tool-use.ts` was POSTing `/agentmemory/enrich` on every `Edit`/`Write`/`Read`/`Glob`/`Grep` tool call and piping up to 4000 chars to stdout. The Claude Code docs make clear that PreToolUse stdout goes to the debug log, not the model context, so this was **not** burning user tokens — but it was spawning a Node process + full HTTP round-trip ~20x per user message with no effect on the conversation. Gating it makes the disabled hot path a ~15ms no-op Node startup instead of a ~100-300ms REST round-trip. **This is a resource cleanup, not a token fix**; leaving the gate in place protects forward in case Claude Code ever changes PreToolUse to inject stdout like SessionStart does.
- **`mem::retention-evict` no longer leaks semantic memories** ([#124](https://github.com/rohitg00/agentmemory/issues/124)) — the eviction loop was unconditionally calling `kv.delete(KV.memories, id)` for every below-threshold candidate, but retention scores are computed for both episodic (`KV.memories`) and semantic (`KV.semantic`) memories. When a candidate came from `KV.semantic`, the delete silently became a no-op (key wasn't in `mem:memories` to begin with) and the semantic row stayed alive forever with a sub-threshold score. Semantic memories could not be evicted by this path at all. Fix: add a `source: "episodic" | "semantic"` discriminator to `RetentionScore`, tag it at score creation, and branch the delete on `candidate.source`. For pre-0.8.10 rows with no `source` field (including semantic retention rows written by the old scorer), the loop probes both namespaces to find where the `memoryId` actually lives, so upgraded stores get their stranded semantic memories evicted without needing to re-score first. The response shape now also includes `evictedEpisodic` and `evictedSemantic` counts for observability.
- **`mem::retention-evict` now emits an audit record per sweep** ([#124](https://github.com/rohitg00/agentmemory/issues/124)) — retention eviction performs structural deletes (memories, retention scores, access logs) but was not calling `recordAudit()`, which made evictions invisible to audit consumers. Now batched one audit row per non-zero sweep, with `operation: "delete"`, `functionId: "mem::retention-evict"`, `targetIds` containing every evicted id, and `details.evicted` / `evictedEpisodic` / `evictedSemantic` / `threshold` for context. Zero-eviction sweeps intentionally do not write an audit row.

### Honest note on #143

My initial diagnosis on the #143 thread pattern-matched too quickly to #138 and overclaimed that PreToolUse stdout was the smoking gun behind "Claude Pro burned in 4 messages". It wasn't — per the docs, PreToolUse stdout is debug-log only. The actual background cause is that [Claude Pro's Claude Code quotas are documented as tight](https://www.theregister.com/2026/03/31/anthropic_claude_code_limits/) and Anthropic has publicly confirmed "people are hitting usage limits in Claude Code way faster than expected." agentmemory contributes ~1-2K tokens per session via SessionStart, and that contribution is worth eliminating, but this release does not and cannot make Claude Pro's base quotas roomier. Users on heavy tool-call workloads should consider Max 5x or Team tiers regardless of whether agentmemory is installed.

0.8.8's #138 fix (opt-in `mem::compress` via `AGENTMEMORY_AUTO_COMPRESS`) remains the correct fix for users with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set — that path was a real per-observation Claude API burn and is unrelated to the Claude Code hook pipeline.

### Added

- **`AGENTMEMORY_INJECT_CONTEXT` env var** — default `false`. When `true`, restores the old SessionStart stdout write and the old PreToolUse `/enrich` round-trip. Startup banner prints a loud warning when it's on, mirroring the `AGENTMEMORY_AUTO_COMPRESS` warning from 0.8.8.
- **`isContextInjectionEnabled()`** helper in `src/config.ts` — single source of truth for the flag. The hooks read the env var directly (they're spawned as standalone `.mjs` files by Claude Code and don't bootstrap through `src/index.ts`), so the helper is there for the startup banner and future code paths.
- **5 subprocess regression tests** in `test/context-injection.test.ts` — spawns the compiled `pre-tool-use.mjs` and `session-start.mjs` hooks with real stdin/stdout pipes and asserts that stdout is empty when the env var is unset, when it's explicitly `false`, and that the disabled PreToolUse path exits under 1 second. Also asserts that the opt-in path with an unreachable backend still exits cleanly. Full suite: **724 passing** (was 719 + 5 new).

### Infrastructure

- **Startup banner** (`src/index.ts`) now prints `Context injection: OFF (default, #143)` on normal startup and a prominent WARNING when opt-in is enabled, so the mode is never silent.
- **Migration note**: if you were relying on the old SessionStart project-context injection or the old PreToolUse enrichment round-trip, add to `~/.agentmemory/.env`:
  ```env
  AGENTMEMORY_INJECT_CONTEXT=true
  ```
  and restart Claude Code. You'll see the startup warning in the engine logs confirming it's active.

[0.8.10]: https://github.com/rohitg00/agentmemory/compare/v0.8.9...v0.8.10

## [0.8.9] — 2026-04-14

Two UX fixes for the Claude Code plugin install path, both reported in [#139](https://github.com/rohitg00/agentmemory/issues/139) by [@stefanfaur](https://github.com/stefanfaur).

### Fixed

- **Claude Code plugin now auto-wires the `@agentmemory/mcp` stdio server** ([#139](https://github.com/rohitg00/agentmemory/issues/139)) — the plugin previously only shipped hooks and skills, and the README told Claude Code users to wire up the MCP server manually. A new `plugin/.mcp.json` declares the MCP server so `/plugin install agentmemory@agentmemory` auto-starts it when the plugin is enabled. No extra config step.
- **Skills no longer fail under Claude Code's sandbox with "Contains expansion"** ([#139](https://github.com/rohitg00/agentmemory/issues/139)) — the `recall` and `session-history` skills used pre-execution bash with `$(...)` / `${VAR:-default}` shell expansion, which Claude Code's sandbox rejects by pattern match. All four plugin skills (`recall`, `remember`, `forget`, `session-history`) are now rewritten as pure prompts that tell Claude to use the MCP tools directly. No bash, no sandbox issues, no shell escaping — and the skills run faster because they no longer fork a curl subprocess on every invocation.

### Added

- **Standalone MCP shim now implements `memory_smart_search` and `memory_governance_delete`** — the `@agentmemory/mcp` stdio server only exposed 5 tools (`memory_save`, `memory_recall`, `memory_sessions`, `memory_export`, `memory_audit`), so the rewritten plugin skills would have failed at runtime referencing tools the standalone didn't know about. Now ships 7 tools. `memory_smart_search` falls back to the same substring filter as `memory_recall` since the standalone shim doesn't have BM25/vector/graph without the full engine. `memory_governance_delete` takes `memoryIds` as an array or comma-separated string and returns `{deleted, requested, reason}`.
- **`memory_save` accepts `concepts`/`files` as arrays or comma-separated strings** — the old standalone only accepted CSV strings, which would silently drop array inputs. New `normalizeList()` helper handles both.
- **`memory_sessions` honours a `limit` arg** (default 20) — previously returned every session.
- **8 regression tests** in `test/mcp-standalone.test.ts` covering array/CSV inputs for `memory_save`, `memory_smart_search` substring fallback, `memory_sessions` limit, `memory_governance_delete` happy path + unknown-id skip + validation. Full suite: 715 passing.

### Changed

- **README Claude Code install snippet** — now explicitly notes that `/plugin install agentmemory` registers hooks + skills AND auto-wires the MCP server via `.mcp.json`, with no extra step.

[0.8.9]: https://github.com/rohitg00/agentmemory/compare/v0.8.8...v0.8.9

## [0.8.8] — 2026-04-14

**Behavior change**: per-observation LLM compression is now opt-in. If you were relying on LLM-generated summaries (the old default), set `AGENTMEMORY_AUTO_COMPRESS=true` in `~/.agentmemory/.env` and restart.

### Fixed

- **Stop silently burning Claude API tokens on every tool invocation** ([#138](https://github.com/rohitg00/agentmemory/issues/138), thanks [@olcor1](https://github.com/olcor1)) — the old `mem::observe` path fired `mem::compress` unconditionally on every PostToolUse hook, which called Claude via the user's `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to turn each raw observation into a structured summary. An active coding session (50-200 tool calls/hour) could run through hundreds of thousands of tokens in minutes, which is the exact opposite of what a memory tool should do. The new default path skips the LLM call and uses a zero-token **synthetic compression** step that derives `type`, `title`, `narrative`, and `files` from the raw tool name, tool input, and tool output directly. Recall and BM25 search still work — you just lose the LLM-generated summaries unless you opt in.

### Added

- **`AGENTMEMORY_AUTO_COMPRESS` env var** — default `false`. When `true`, restores the old per-observation LLM compression path. The engine startup banner now prints a loud warning when it's on, reminding you that it spends tokens proportional to your session tool-use frequency.
- **`src/functions/compress-synthetic.ts`** — the new zero-LLM compression helper. `buildSyntheticCompression(raw)` maps tool names to `ObservationType` (via camelCase-aware substring matching for `Read`/`Write`/`Edit`/`Bash`/`Grep`/`WebFetch`/`Task`/etc.), pulls file paths out of `tool_input.file_path` / `pattern` / etc., and truncates narratives to 400 chars so one huge tool output can't blow up the BM25 index.
- **Regression test** `test/auto-compress.test.ts` — 8 cases covering the default path (no `mem::compress` trigger, synthetic observation stored in KV), explicit opt-in, tool-name-to-type mapping, file-path extraction, narrative truncation, and the `post_tool_failure` → `error` path. Full suite: 707 passing.

### Infrastructure

- **Startup banner** (`src/index.ts:171`) now prints either `Auto-compress: OFF (default, #138)` or a prominent warning when opt-in is enabled, so the mode is never silent.
- **Migration note**: if you were running 0.8.7 or earlier with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set, your token usage will drop sharply on upgrade. Search quality may also drop slightly because narratives are now derived from raw tool I/O instead of Claude-generated summaries. If you want the old behavior:
  ```env
  # ~/.agentmemory/.env
  AGENTMEMORY_AUTO_COMPRESS=true
  ```
  and restart. Existing compressed observations in `~/.agentmemory/` are untouched.

[0.8.8]: https://github.com/rohitg00/agentmemory/compare/v0.8.7...v0.8.8

## [0.8.7] — 2026-04-14

One-line fix for a brown-paper-bag bug reported in [#136](https://github.com/rohitg00/agentmemory/issues/136).

### Fixed

- **`npx @agentmemory/agentmemory` no longer crashes with "`/app/config.yaml` is a directory"** ([#136](https://github.com/rohitg00/agentmemory/issues/136), thanks [@stefano-medapps](https://github.com/stefano-medapps)) — the published tarball shipped `docker-compose.yml` but **not** `iii-config.docker.yaml`, even though the compose file mounts `./iii-config.docker.yaml:/app/config.yaml:ro`. Docker resolves missing host-path bind sources by silently creating them as empty directories, so the iii-engine container mounted an empty dir at `/app/config.yaml` and crashed with `Error: Failed to read config file '/app/config.yaml': Is a directory (os error 21)`. The `files` array in `package.json` now includes `iii-config.docker.yaml` alongside the regular `iii-config.yaml`.

### Infrastructure

- New regression test in `test/consistency.test.ts` parses every `./<path>:<container>` bind mount in `docker-compose.yml` and asserts the source file is shipped via the `files` array. Catches the class of bug where a new bind mount is added to compose without a corresponding entry in `files`.

[0.8.7]: https://github.com/rohitg00/agentmemory/compare/v0.8.6...v0.8.7

## [0.8.6] — 2026-04-13

Finishes the `npx <shim>` story from #120 by moving the standalone package under the `@agentmemory` scope.

### Changed

- **Standalone MCP shim is now `@agentmemory/mcp`** — the 0.8.5 publish attempted to push `agentmemory-mcp` as an unscoped package, but npm's name-similarity policy rejects it because of an unrelated third-party package called `agent-memory-mcp`. The shim now lives under the scope we already own, so `npx -y @agentmemory/mcp` works on the live registry. All README/integration/CLI-help snippets, the OpenClaw and Hermes guides, and the Claude-Desktop/Cursor/Codex/OpenCode MCP config examples have been updated to use the scoped name. The unscoped `agentmemory-mcp` command line (in the main package's `bin` field) was never published and has been removed from the docs.
- **Package directory renamed** `packages/agentmemory-mcp/` → `packages/mcp/`. The `.github/workflows/publish.yml` publish step points at the new path and `npm view @agentmemory/mcp` for the propagation check.
- **Log prefix** in `src/mcp/standalone.ts` and `src/mcp/in-memory-kv.ts` changed from `[agentmemory-mcp]` to `[@agentmemory/mcp]` so stderr output matches the package users install.

### Fixed

- **Shim version bump was missed in 0.8.5** — `packages/agentmemory-mcp/package.json` (now `packages/mcp/package.json`) was still pinned at `0.8.4` because the release bump script only touched the 8 files in the main package. The shim now tracks the main package and depends on `@agentmemory/agentmemory: ~0.8.6`.

[0.8.6]: https://github.com/rohitg00/agentmemory/compare/v0.8.5...v0.8.6

## [0.8.5] — 2026-04-13

Compatibility fix for stricter JSON-RPC clients, plus a spec cleanup CodeRabbit caught during review.

### Fixed

- **MCP server works with Codex CLI and any strict JSON-RPC 2.0 client** ([#129](https://github.com/rohitg00/agentmemory/issues/129)) — the stdio transport was responding to JSON-RPC **notifications** (messages without an `id` field, e.g. `notifications/initialized`), which violates JSON-RPC 2.0 §4.1 and caused stricter clients like Codex CLI v0.120.0 to close the transport with "Transport closed". Notifications are now detected by the missing/null `id` field, the handler still runs for side effects, but no response is written. Handler errors on notifications are logged to stderr instead of sent back to the client. Claude Code and other clients that tolerated the spurious responses continue to work unchanged.
- **Request `id` type validation per JSON-RPC 2.0 §4** — the transport previously only checked `id != null`, so a malformed request with `id: {}` or `id: [1,2]` could get echoed back with that non-primitive id, and valid-shape requests with bad id types fell through to the handler and produced a response carrying a bogus non-JSON-RPC id. `isValidId()` now enforces `string | number | null | undefined`, and bad-id requests get `-32600 Invalid Request` with `id: null` before the handler runs. Caught by CodeRabbit on PR [#131](https://github.com/rohitg00/agentmemory/pull/131).

### Infrastructure

- 14 tests in `test/mcp-transport.test.ts` covering the request path, notification path (#129), malformed input, and id-type validation (object/array/boolean). Full suite: 698 passing.

[0.8.5]: https://github.com/rohitg00/agentmemory/compare/v0.8.4...v0.8.5

## [0.8.4] — 2026-04-13

Two community contributions land on top of 0.8.3 and close out the #120 npm story for real.

### Fixed

- **Memories saved via the standalone MCP server now survive SIGKILL** ([#122](https://github.com/rohitg00/agentmemory/pull/122), thanks [@JasonLandbridge](https://github.com/JasonLandbridge)) — `memory_save` previously only flushed to `~/.agentmemory/standalone.json` on `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`. If the MCP server process was killed forcefully (e.g. when an agent session ended), every memory saved during that session was lost. The save handler now persists to disk immediately after every `memory_save` call, so data survives unexpected termination. Also switched to the shared `generateId("mem")` helper and a single `isoNow` shared by `createdAt`/`updatedAt` so they can't drift.
- **OpenCode MCP config format corrected** ([#121](https://github.com/rohitg00/agentmemory/pull/121), thanks [@JasonLandbridge](https://github.com/JasonLandbridge)) — the README previously told OpenCode users to edit `.opencode/config.json` with an `mcpServers` object, but OpenCode actually uses `opencode.json` with an `mcp` object, `type: "local"`, and a `command` array. The agents table row and a new dedicated OpenCode block in the Standalone MCP section now document the correct format.

## [0.8.3] — 2026-04-13

Two bug fixes reported in the public issue tracker.

### Fixed

- **Retention score now reflects real agent-side reads** ([#119](https://github.com/rohitg00/agentmemory/issues/119)) — `mem::retention-score` previously hardcoded `accessCount = 0` and `accessTimestamps = []` for episodic memories, and only used a single-sample `lastAccessedAt` for semantic memories. Reads from `mem::search`, `mem::smart-search`, `mem::context`, `mem::timeline`, `mem::file-context`, and the matching MCP tools (`memory_recall`, `memory_smart_search`, `memory_timeline`, `memory_file_history`) were never recorded, so the time-frequency decay formula was a dead path. The reinforcement boost is now driven by a real per-memory access log persisted at `mem:access`, written by every read endpoint (fire-and-forget, so reads never block on tracker writes), with a bounded ring buffer of the last 20 access timestamps. Pre-0.8.3 semantic memories that only have the legacy `lastAccessedAt` field still score correctly via a backwards-compat fallback.
- **`npx agentmemory-mcp` 404** ([#120](https://github.com/rohitg00/agentmemory/issues/120)) — the README told users to run `npx agentmemory-mcp` for MCP client setup, but `agentmemory-mcp` was only a `bin` entry inside `@agentmemory/agentmemory`, not a real package, so `npx` returned 404 from the npm registry. Two fixes:
  - Published a new sibling package `agentmemory-mcp` (in `packages/agentmemory-mcp/`) that is a thin shim over `@agentmemory/agentmemory/dist/standalone.mjs`. `npx agentmemory-mcp` now works as documented.
  - Added a canonical `npx @agentmemory/agentmemory mcp` subcommand to the main CLI for users who already have `@agentmemory/agentmemory` installed and don't want a second package on disk. Both commands do the same thing.
  - README install snippets now use `npx -y agentmemory-mcp` so first-time users skip the install confirmation prompt.

### Added

- **Concurrent access tracking is race-safe** — the access log RMW is wrapped in the existing `withKeyedLock` keyed mutex, so two parallel reads of the same memory don't lose increments. `recordAccessBatch` uses `Promise.allSettled` so a slow keyed-lock acquisition on one id doesn't block the rest of the batch.
- **`mem::export` / `mem::import` now round-trip the access log** — the new `mem:access` namespace is included in dumps and restored on import, so backup/restore cycles no longer silently zero out reinforcement signals.
- **`exports` field in `package.json`** — explicitly exposes `./dist/standalone.mjs` as a subpath so the shim package and external consumers have a stable contract.
- **CI publishes both packages on release** — `.github/workflows/publish.yml` now publishes `@agentmemory/agentmemory` first, then the `agentmemory-mcp` shim from `packages/agentmemory-mcp/` so `npx agentmemory-mcp` works on the live release.

## [0.8.2] — 2026-04-12

This release ships 6 security fixes, growth features, and a visual redesign of the README. Users on v0.8.1 should upgrade as soon as possible — the security fixes address vulnerabilities in default deployments.

### Security

Six vulnerabilities fixed, originally introduced before v0.8.1:

- **[CRITICAL] Stored XSS in the real-time viewer** — viewer HTML used inline `onclick=` handlers while the CSP allowed `script-src 'unsafe-inline'`. User-controlled tool outputs could execute JavaScript in the reader's browser. Fixed by removing all inline event handlers, adding delegated `data-action` handling, switching to a per-response nonce-based CSP, and adding `script-src-attr 'none'`.
- **[CRITICAL] `curl | sh` in CLI startup** — the CLI auto-installed iii-engine via `execSync("curl -fsSL https://install.iii.dev/iii/main/install.sh | sh")`. Removed entirely. The CLI now uses an existing local `iii` binary if available, or falls back to Docker Compose. Users install iii-engine manually via `cargo install iii-engine` or Docker.
- **[HIGH] Default `0.0.0.0` binding** — `iii-config.yaml` bound REST (3111) and streams (3112) to all interfaces, exposing the memory store to anyone on the local network. Now binds to `127.0.0.1` by default. A separate `iii-config.docker.yaml` handles the Docker case with host port mapping restricted to `127.0.0.1:port`.
- **[HIGH] Unauthenticated mesh sync** — mesh push/pull endpoints accepted requests without an `Authorization` header. Mesh endpoints now require `AGENTMEMORY_SECRET`, and outgoing mesh sync requests send `Authorization: Bearer <secret>`.
- **[MEDIUM] Path traversal in Obsidian export** — the `vaultDir` parameter was passed directly to `mkdir`/`writeFile`, allowing writes to any filesystem path (e.g., `/etc/cron.d`). Exports are now confined to `AGENTMEMORY_EXPORT_ROOT` (default `~/.agentmemory`) via `path.resolve` + `startsWith` containment check.
- **[MEDIUM] Incomplete secret redaction** — the privacy filter missed `Bearer ...` tokens, OpenAI project keys (`sk-proj-*`), and GitHub fine-grained service tokens (`ghs_`, `ghu_`). Added regex coverage for all three formats.

See GitHub Security Advisories for CVSS scores and affected version ranges.

### Added

- **`agentmemory demo` CLI command** — seeds 3 realistic sessions (JWT auth, N+1 query fix, rate limiting) and runs smart-search queries against them. Shows semantic search finding "N+1 query fix" when you search "database performance optimization" — the kind of result keyword matching can't produce. Zero config, 30 seconds, no integration needed.
- **`benchmark/COMPARISON.md`** — head-to-head comparison vs mem0 (53K⭐), Letta/MemGPT (22K⭐), Khoj (34K⭐), claude-mem (46K⭐), and Hippo. 18-dimension feature matrix, honest LongMemEval vs LoCoMo caveats, token efficiency table.
- **`integrations/openclaw/`** — OpenClaw gateway plugin with 4 lifecycle hooks (`onSessionStart`, `onPreLlmCall`, `onPostToolUse`, `onSessionEnd`). Same pattern as the existing Hermes integration. Includes README with paste-this-prompt block, `plugin.yaml`, and `plugin.mjs`.
- **Token savings dashboard** — `agentmemory status` now shows cumulative token savings and dollar cost saved (`$0.30/1K tokens` rate). Same card added to the real-time viewer on port 3113.
- **Paste-this-prompt blocks** — main README and both integration READMEs now open with a copy-pasteable text block users drop into their agent. The agent handles the entire setup (start server, update MCP config, verify health, open viewer).
- **60 custom SVG tags** — 30 dark-bg + 30 light-bg variants under `assets/tags/` and `assets/tags/light/`. Covers 14 section headers, 6 stat cards, 8 pill tags, and utility badges. GitHub README uses `<picture>` elements to auto-swap based on reader theme (dark theme → light-bg SVGs, light theme → dark-bg SVGs).
- **Real agent logos** in the Supported Agents grid — 16 agents with clickable brand logos (Claude Code, OpenClaw, Hermes, Cursor, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Codex CLI, Cline, Goose, Kilo Code, Aider, Claude Desktop, Windsurf, Roo Code, Claude SDK, plus "any MCP client").

### Changed

- README redesigned from plain markdown headers to SVG-tagged sections matching the agentmemory brand palette (orange `#FF6B35 → #FF8F5E` accent on dark `#1A1A1A` background).
- Hero stat row replaced with 6 custom SVG stat cards showing 95.2% R@5, 92% fewer tokens, 43 MCP tools, 12 auto hooks, 0 external DBs, 654 tests passing.
- Supported Agents grid reordered: Claude Code, OpenClaw, and Hermes now lead the first row (the 3 agents with first-class integrations in `integrations/`).
- Viewer token savings card now shows dollar cost saved alongside raw token count.
- Default configuration files updated: `iii-config.yaml` binds to `127.0.0.1`, new `iii-config.docker.yaml` for Docker deployments.

### Fixed

- **Viewer cost calculation was 100x under-reporting** — the formula `tokensSaved / 1000 * 0.3` returns dollars but was treated as cents. Now computes `costDollars` first, then `costCents = Math.round(costDollars * 100)`. 100K tokens now correctly displays `$30.00` instead of `30ct`.
- **`ObservationType` union missing `"image"`** — `VALID_TYPES` in `compress.ts` included `"image"` but the TypeScript union in `types.ts` didn't, breaking exhaustive checks.
- **Dynamic imports inside eviction loops** — `auto-forget.ts` and `evict.ts` called `await import("../utils/image-store.js")` inside nested loops. Hoisted once at the top of each function.
- **OpenClaw `/agentmemory/context` payload** — plugin was sending `{ tokenBudget, query, minConfidence }` but the endpoint expects `{ sessionId, project, budget? }`. Fixed to match the server contract.
- **Cursor cell in README grid** was missing its `<strong>Cursor</strong>` label.
- Codex CLI logo URL returned 404 from simple-icons CDN. Switched to GitHub org avatars for all logos for maximum reliability.

### Infrastructure

- 654 tests (up from 646 in v0.8.1), including 8 new tests covering viewer security, mesh auth, privacy redaction, and export confinement.
- All 60 custom SVGs validated with `xmllint` in CI-ready fashion.
- README consistency check updated to match new tool counts.
