You explain the same architecture every session. You re-discover the same bugs. You re-teach the same preferences. Built-in memory (CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules) caps out at 200 lines and goes stale. agentmemory fixes this. It silently captures what your agent does, compresses it into searchable memory, and injects the right context when the next session starts. One command. Works across agents.

**What changes:** Session 1 you set up JWT auth. Session 2 you ask for rate limiting. The agent already knows your auth uses jose middleware in `src/middleware/auth.ts`, your tests cover token validation, and you chose jose over jsonwebtoken for Edge compatibility. No re-explaining. No copy-pasting. The agent just *knows*.

| | |
|---|---|
| **95.2% R@5** | [LongMemEval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10813) (ICLR 2025) retrieval accuracy |
| **92% fewer tokens** | ~1,900 injected vs ~19,000 full context ($10/yr vs $500+/yr) |
| **43 MCP tools** | Search, remember, forget, actions, leases, signals, mesh sync |
| **12 hooks** | Captures every tool use automatically, zero manual effort |
| **0 external deps** | No Postgres, no Redis, no vector DB. Just iii-engine (auto-installed) |

```bash
npx @agentmemory/agentmemory   # installs iii-engine if missing, starts everything
```

---

## Quick Start

### Claude Code (paste this, the agent does the rest)

```
Install agentmemory: run `npx @agentmemory/agentmemory` in a separate terminal to start the memory server. Then run `/plugin marketplace add rohitg00/agentmemory` and `/plugin install agentmemory` to register all 12 hooks, 4 skills, and 43 MCP tools. Verify with `curl http://localhost:3111/agentmemory/health`. The real-time viewer is at http://localhost:3113.
```

That's it. Paste the block above into Claude Code. The agent handles installation, engine startup, plugin registration, and verification.

### Other agents

Start the memory server first: `npx @agentmemory/agentmemory`

| Agent | Setup |
|---|---|
| **Cursor** | Add to `~/.cursor/mcp.json`: `{"mcpServers": {"agentmemory": {"command": "npx", "args": ["agentmemory-mcp"]}}}` |
| **Gemini CLI** | `gemini mcp add agentmemory -- npx agentmemory-mcp` |
| **Hermes Agent** | Add to `~/.hermes/config.yaml`: `mcp_servers: {agentmemory: {command: npx, args: ["agentmemory-mcp"]}}` or use the [memory provider plugin](integrations/hermes/) |
| **OpenCode** | Add to `.opencode/config.json`: `{"mcpServers": {"agentmemory": {"command": "npx", "args": ["agentmemory-mcp"]}}}` |
| **Claude Desktop** | Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`: `{"mcpServers": {"agentmemory": {"command": "npx", "args": ["agentmemory-mcp"]}}}` |
| **Any agent (32+)** | `npx skillkit install agentmemory` |
| **REST API** | `curl -X POST http://localhost:3111/agentmemory/smart-search -d '{"query": "auth"}'` |

---

## Why agentmemory

Every coding agent forgets everything when the session ends. You waste the first 5 minutes of every session re-explaining your stack, your conventions, your recent decisions. agentmemory runs in the background and eliminates that entirely.

```
Session 1: "Add auth to the API"
  Agent writes code, runs tests, fixes bugs
  agentmemory silently captures every tool use
  Session ends -> observations compressed into structured memory

Session 2: "Now add rate limiting"
  Agent already knows:
    - Auth uses JWT middleware in src/middleware/auth.ts
    - Tests in test/auth.test.ts cover token validation
    - You chose jose over jsonwebtoken for Edge compatibility
    - The rate limit discussion from last week's debugging session
  Zero re-explaining. Starts working immediately.
```

### What it gives you

| Capability | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Automatic capture** | Every tool use, file edit, test run, and error is silently recorded via hooks |
| **LLM compression** | Raw observations are compressed into structured facts, concepts, and narratives |
| **Context injection** | Past knowledge is injected at session start within a configurable token budget |
| **Semantic search** | Hybrid BM25 + vector search finds relevant memories even with different wording |
| **Memory evolution** | Memories version over time, supersede each other, and form relationship graphs |
| **Project profiles** | Aggregated per-project intelligence: top concepts, files, conventions, common errors |
| **Auto-forgetting** | TTL expiry, contradiction detection, and importance-based eviction keep memory clean |
| **Privacy first** | API keys, secrets, and `<private>` tags are stripped before anything is stored |
| **Self-healing** | Circuit breaker, provider fallback chain, self-correcting LLM output, health monitoring |
| **Claude Code bridge** | Bi-directional sync with `~/.claude/projects/*/memory/MEMORY.md` |
| **Cross-agent MCP** | Standalone MCP server for Cursor, Codex, Gemini CLI, Windsurf, any MCP client |
| **Citation provenance** | JIT verification traces any memory back to source observations and sessions |
| **Cascading staleness** | Superseded memories auto-flag related graph nodes, edges, and siblings as stale |
| **Knowledge graph** | Entity extraction + BFS traversal across files, functions, concepts, errors |
| **4-tier memory** | Working → episodic → semantic → procedural consolidation with strength decay |
| **Team memory** | Namespaced shared + private memory across team members |
| **Governance** | Edit, delete, bulk-delete, and audit trail for all memory operations |
| **Git snapshots** | Version, rollback, and diff memory state via git commits |

### How it compares to built-in agent memory

Every AI coding agent now ships with built-in memory. Claude Code has `MEMORY.md`, Cursor has notepads, Cline has memory bank. These work like sticky notes: fast, always-on, but fundamentally limited.

agentmemory is the searchable database behind the sticky notes.

| | Built-in (CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules) | agentmemory |
|---|---|---|
| Scale | 200-line cap (MEMORY.md) | Unlimited |
| Search | Loads everything into context | BM25 + vector + graph (returns top-K only) |
| Token cost | 22K+ tokens at 240 observations | ~1,900 tokens (92% less) |
| At 1K observations | 80% of memories invisible | 100% searchable |
| At 5K observations | Exceeds context window | Still ~2K tokens |
| Cross-session recall | Only within line cap | Full corpus search |
| Cross-agent | Per-agent files (no sharing) | MCP + REST API (any agent) |
| Multi-agent coordination | Impossible | Leases, signals, actions, routines |
| Cross-agent sync | No | P2P mesh (7 scopes: memories, actions, semantic, procedural, relations, graph) |
| Memory trust | No verification | Citation chain back to source observations with confidence scores |
| Semantic search | No (keyword grep) | Yes (95.2% R@5 on LongMemEval-S) |
| Memory lifecycle | Manual pruning | Ebbinghaus decay + tiered eviction |
| Knowledge graph | No | Entity extraction + temporal versioning |
| Observability | Read files manually | Real-time viewer on :3113 |

### What it costs (spoiler: almost nothing)

| Approach | Tokens/year | Annual cost | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Paste full history into context | 19.5M+ | Impossible | Exceeds context window after ~200 observations |
| LLM-summarized memory (extraction-based) | ~650K | ~$500/yr | Loses context, summarization is lossy |
| **agentmemory context injection** | **~170K** | **~$10/yr** | Token-budgeted, only relevant memories injected |
| agentmemory with local embeddings | ~170K | **$0** | all-MiniLM-L6-v2 runs locally, no API calls |

### How memory flows

```text
PostToolUse hook fires
  -> SHA-256 dedup (5min window)
  -> Privacy filter (strip secrets, API keys)
  -> Store raw observation
  -> LLM compress -> structured facts + concepts + narrative
  -> Generate vector embedding
  -> Index in BM25 + vector + knowledge graph

SessionStart hook fires
  -> Load project profile (top concepts, files, patterns)
  -> Hybrid search (BM25 + vector + graph) for recent context
  -> Apply token budget (default: 2000 tokens)
  -> Inject into conversation via stdout
```

### Benchmarks (measured, not projected)

#### LongMemEval-S (ICLR 2025, 500 questions)

Evaluated on [LongMemEval-S](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10813), an academic benchmark with 500 questions across ~48 sessions per question (~115K tokens). Same dataset and metric (`recall_any@K`) used by other memory systems.

| System | R@5 | R@10 | NDCG@10 | MRR |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **agentmemory BM25+Vector** | **95.2%** | **98.6%** | **87.9%** | **88.2%** |
| agentmemory BM25-only | 86.2% | 94.6% | 73.0% | 71.5% |

These are retrieval recall scores (not end-to-end QA accuracy). Embedding model: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (local, no API key).

#### Internal benchmark (240 observations, 20 queries)

| System | Recall@10 | NDCG@10 | MRR | Tokens/query |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Built-in (grep all into context) | 55.8% | 80.3% | 82.5% | 19,462 |
| agentmemory BM25 (stemmed + synonyms) | 55.9% | 82.7% | 95.5% | 1,571 |
| agentmemory + Xenova embeddings | **64.1%** | **94.9%** | **100.0%** | **1,571** |

agentmemory finds "N+1 query fix" when you search "database performance optimization". Keyword matching can't do this.

> **Methodology note:** All LongMemEval numbers are retrieval recall (`recall_any@K`), not end-to-end QA accuracy. We clearly distinguish these because the LongMemEval leaderboard measures QA accuracy (retrieve + generate + judge). No hyperparameters were tuned on the test set. Full scripts and results are committed and reproducible.

Full benchmark reports: [`benchmark/LONGMEMEVAL.md`](benchmark/LONGMEMEVAL.md), [`benchmark/QUALITY.md`](benchmark/QUALITY.md), [`benchmark/SCALE.md`](benchmark/SCALE.md), [`benchmark/REAL-EMBEDDINGS.md`](benchmark/REAL-EMBEDDINGS.md)

## Supported Agents

agentmemory works with any agent that supports hooks, MCP, or via its REST API.

### Native hook support (zero config)

These agents support hooks natively. agentmemory captures tool usage automatically via its 12 hooks.

| Agent | Integration | Setup |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | 12 hooks (all types) | `/plugin install agentmemory` or manual hook config |
| **Claude Code SDK** | Agent SDK provider | Built-in `AgentSDKProvider` uses your Claude subscription |

### MCP support (any MCP-compatible agent)

Any agent that connects to MCP servers can use agentmemory's 43 tools, 6 resources, and 3 prompts. The agent actively queries and saves memory through MCP calls.

| Agent | How to connect |
|---|---|
| **Cursor** | Add MCP server in settings or `~/.cursor/mcp.json` |
| **Claude Desktop** | Add to `claude_desktop_config.json` MCP servers |
| **Gemini CLI** | `gemini mcp add agentmemory -- npx agentmemory-mcp` |
| **OpenCode** | Add to `.opencode/config.json` MCP servers |
| **Cline / Continue** | MCP server configuration |
| **Any MCP client** | Point to `http://localhost:3111/agentmemory/mcp/*` |

### REST API (any agent, any language)

Agents without hooks or MCP can integrate via 103 REST endpoints directly. This works with any agent, language, or framework.

```bash
POST /agentmemory/observe       # Capture what the agent did
POST /agentmemory/smart-search  # Find relevant memories
POST /agentmemory/context       # Get context for injection
POST /agentmemory/enrich        # Get enriched context (files + memories + bugs)
POST /agentmemory/remember      # Save long-term memory
GET  /agentmemory/profile       # Get project intelligence
```

### Choosing an integration method

| Your situation | Use |
|---|---|
| Claude Code user | Plugin install (hooks + MCP + skills) |
| Building a custom agent with Claude SDK | AgentSDKProvider (zero config) |
| Using Cursor, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, or any MCP client | MCP server (43 tools + 6 resources + 3 prompts) |
| Building your own agent framework | REST API (103 endpoints) |
| Sharing memory across multiple agents | All agents point to the same iii-engine instance |

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rohitg00/agentmemory.git && cd agentmemory
npm install && npm run build && npm start
```

## First Steps After Install

Once hooks are installed, memory builds silently. No action needed. Just use your agent normally.

### Session 1: Your agent works as usual

```text
You: "Add JWT auth to the Express API"
Agent: reads files, writes code, runs tests, fixes errors
```

agentmemory captures every tool use via PostToolUse hooks. At session end, 47 raw observations compress into structured memory:

```json
{
  "type": "file_edit",
  "title": "Implement JWT middleware with jose",
  "facts": ["Using jose library for Edge compatibility", "JWT tokens expire after 30 days", "Middleware in src/middleware/auth.ts"],
  "concepts": ["jwt", "authentication", "jose", "middleware"],
  "files": ["src/middleware/auth.ts", "src/app/api/auth/route.ts"],
  "importance": 9
}
```

### Session 2: The payoff

You start a new session. Before the agent responds, the SessionStart hook fires and injects context (~1,900 tokens):

```text
Agent already knows:
  - Auth uses jose JWT middleware in src/middleware/auth.ts
  - Tests in test/auth.test.ts cover token validation
  - You chose jose over jsonwebtoken for Edge compatibility
  - Rate limiting discussion from last week's debugging session
```

No re-explaining. The agent starts working immediately.

### How to verify it's working

```bash
npx @agentmemory/agentmemory status   # quick terminal check
curl http://localhost:3111/agentmemory/health
open http://localhost:3113              # real-time viewer
```

After 1 session: check the Timeline tab in the viewer. After 2+ sessions: check Dashboard for memory count > 0 and the Token Savings card.

## How It Works

### Observation Pipeline

```
PostToolUse hook fires
  -> Dedup check      SHA-256 hash (5min window, no duplicates)
  -> mem::privacy     Strip secrets, API keys, <private> tags
  -> mem::observe     Store raw observation, push to real-time stream
  -> mem::compress    LLM extracts: type, facts, narrative, concepts, files
                      Validates with Zod, scores quality (0-100)
                      Self-corrects on validation failure (1 retry)
                      Generates vector embedding for semantic search
```

### Context Injection

```
SessionStart hook fires
  -> mem::context     Load recent sessions for this project
                      Hybrid search (BM25 + vector) across observations
                      Inject project profile (top concepts, files, patterns)
                      Apply token budget (default: 2000 tokens)
  -> stdout           Agent receives context in the conversation
```

### What Gets Captured

| Hook | Captures |
|------|----------|
| `SessionStart` | Project path, session ID, working directory |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | User prompts (privacy-filtered) |
| `PreToolUse` | File access patterns + enriched context injection (Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep) |
| `PostToolUse` | Tool name, input, output |
| `PostToolUseFailure` | Failed tool invocations with error context |
| `PreCompact` | Re-injects memory context before context compaction |
| `SubagentStart/Stop` | Sub-agent lifecycle events |
| `Notification` | System notifications |
| `TaskCompleted` | Task completion events |
| `Stop` | Triggers end-of-session summary |
| `SessionEnd` | Marks session complete |

## Search

agentmemory uses triple-stream retrieval combining three signals for maximum recall.

### How search works

| Stream | What it does | When |
|---|---|---|
| **BM25** | Stemmed keyword matching with synonym expansion and binary-search prefix matching | Always on |
| **Vector** | Cosine similarity over dense embeddings (Xenova, OpenAI, Gemini, Voyage, Cohere, OpenRouter) | Any embedding provider configured |
| **Graph** | Knowledge graph traversal via entity matching and co-occurrence edges | Entities detected in query |

All three streams are fused with Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF, k=60) and session-diversified (max 3 results per session) to maximize coverage.

**BM25 enhancements (v0.6.0):** Porter stemmer normalizes word forms ("authentication" ↔ "authenticating"), coding-domain synonyms expand queries ("db" ↔ "database", "perf" ↔ "performance"), and binary-search prefix matching replaces O(n) scans.

### Embedding providers

agentmemory auto-detects which provider to use. For best results, install local embeddings (no API key needed):

```bash
npm install @xenova/transformers
```

| Provider | Model | Dimensions | Env Var | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Local (recommended)** | `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` | 384 | `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=local` | Free, offline, +8pp recall over BM25-only |
| Gemini | `text-embedding-004` | 768 | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Free tier (1500 RPM) |
| OpenAI | `text-embedding-3-small` | 1536 | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | $0.02/1M tokens |
| Voyage AI | `voyage-code-3` | 1024 | `VOYAGE_API_KEY` | Optimized for code |
| Cohere | `embed-english-v3.0` | 1024 | `COHERE_API_KEY` | Free trial available |
| OpenRouter | Any embedding model | varies | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | Multi-model proxy |

No embedding provider? BM25-only mode with stemming and synonyms still outperforms built-in memory.

### Progressive disclosure

Smart search returns compact results first (title, type, score, timestamp) to save tokens. Expand specific IDs to get full observation details.

```bash
# Compact results (50-100 tokens each)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3111/agentmemory/smart-search \
  -d '{"query": "database migration"}'

# Expand specific results (500-1000 tokens each)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3111/agentmemory/smart-search \
  -d '{"expandIds": ["obs_abc123", "obs_def456"]}'
```

## Memory Evolution

Memories in agentmemory are not static. They version, evolve, and form relationships.

### Versioning

When you save a memory that's similar to an existing one (Jaccard > 0.7), the old memory is superseded:

```
v1: "Use Express for API routes"
v2: "Use Fastify instead of Express for API routes" (supersedes v1)
v3: "Use Hono instead of Fastify for Edge API routes" (supersedes v2)
```

Only the latest version is returned in search results. The full chain is preserved for audit.

### Relationships

Memories can be linked: `supersedes`, `extends`, `derives`, `contradicts`, `related`. Each relationship carries a confidence score (0-1) computed from co-occurrence, recency, and relation type. Traversal follows these links up to N hops, with optional `minConfidence` filtering.

### Auto-forget

agentmemory automatically cleans itself:

| Mechanism | What it does |
|---|---|
| **TTL expiry** | Memories with `forgetAfter` date are deleted when expired |
| **Contradiction detection** | Near-duplicate memories (Jaccard > 0.9), older one is demoted |
| **Low-value eviction** | Observations older than 90 days with importance < 3 are removed |
| **Per-project cap** | Projects are capped at 10,000 observations (lowest importance evicted first) |

Run `POST /agentmemory/auto-forget?dryRun=true` to preview what would be cleaned.

### Project profiles

agentmemory aggregates observations into per-project intelligence:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:3111/agentmemory/profile?project=/my/project"
```

Returns top concepts, most-touched files, coding conventions, common errors, and a session count. This profile is automatically injected into session context.

### Timeline

Navigate observations chronologically around any anchor point:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3111/agentmemory/timeline \
  -d '{"anchor": "2026-02-15", "before": 5, "after": 5}'
```

### Export / Import

Full data portability:

```bash
# Export everything
curl http://localhost:3111/agentmemory/export > backup.json

# Import with merge strategy
curl -X POST http://localhost:3111/agentmemory/import \
  -d '{"exportData": ..., "strategy": "merge"}'
```

Strategies: `merge` (combine), `replace` (overwrite), `skip` (ignore duplicates).

## Self-Evaluation

agentmemory monitors its own health and validates its own output.

### Quality scoring

Every LLM compression is scored 0-100 based on structured facts, narrative quality, concept extraction, title quality, and importance range. Scores are tracked per-function and exposed via `/health`.

### Self-correction

When LLM output fails Zod validation, agentmemory retries with a stricter prompt explaining the exact errors. This recovers from malformed JSON, missing fields, and out-of-range values.

### Circuit breaker + fallback chain

```
Primary provider fails
  -> Circuit breaker opens (3 failures in 60s)
  -> Falls back to next provider in FALLBACK_PROVIDERS chain
  -> 30s cooldown -> half-open -> test call -> recovery
```

Configure with `FALLBACK_PROVIDERS=anthropic,gemini,openrouter`. When all providers are down, observations are stored raw without compression. No data is lost.

### Health monitor

Collects every 30 seconds: heap usage, CPU percentage (delta sampling), event loop lag, connection state. Alerts at warning (80% CPU, 100ms lag) and critical (90% CPU, 500ms lag) thresholds. `GET /agentmemory/health` returns HTTP 503 when critical.

Run agentmemory as a standalone MCP server for any MCP-compatible agent (Cursor, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Claude Desktop, Cline):

```bash
npx agentmemory-mcp
```

Or add to your agent's MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agentmemory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["agentmemory-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

The standalone server uses in-memory KV with optional JSON persistence (`STANDALONE_PERSIST_PATH`).

```

## Skills

Four slash commands for interacting with memory:

| Skill | Usage |
|-------|-------|
| `/recall` | Search memory for past context (`/recall auth middleware`) |
| `/remember` | Save something to long-term memory (`/remember always use jose for JWT`) |
| `/session-history` | Show recent session summaries |
| `/forget` | Delete specific observations or entire sessions |

## Real-Time Viewer

agentmemory includes a real-time web dashboard that auto-starts on port `3113` (configurable via `III_REST_PORT + 2`).

- Live observation stream via WebSocket
- Session explorer with observation details
- Memory browser with search and filtering
- Knowledge graph visualization
- Health and metrics dashboard

Access at `http://localhost:3113` or via `GET /agentmemory/viewer` on the API port. Protected by `AGENTMEMORY_SECRET` when set. CSP headers applied to all HTML responses.

## Configuration

### LLM Providers

agentmemory needs an LLM for compressing observations and generating summaries. It auto-detects from your environment.

| Provider | Config | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Claude subscription** (default) | No config needed | Uses `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`. Zero cost beyond your Max/Pro plan |
| **Anthropic API** | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Direct API access, per-token billing. Supports `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` for custom endpoints |
| **MiniMax** | `MINIMAX_API_KEY` | Anthropic-compatible API. Default model: `MiniMax-M2.7` |
| **Gemini** | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Also enables Gemini embeddings (free tier) |
| **OpenRouter** | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | Access any model through one API |

No API key? agentmemory uses your Claude subscription automatically. Zero config.

## Architecture

agentmemory is built on iii-engine's three primitives:

| What you'd normally need | What agentmemory uses |
|---|---|
| Express.js / Fastify | iii HTTP Triggers |
| SQLite / Postgres + pgvector | iii KV State + in-memory vector index |
| SSE / Socket.io | iii Streams (WebSocket) |
| pm2 / systemd | iii-engine worker management |
| Prometheus / Grafana | iii OTEL + built-in health monitor |
| Redis (circuit breaker) | In-process circuit breaker + fallback chain |

**118 source files. ~21,800 LOC. 646 tests. Zero external DB dependencies.**
